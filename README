# 375-Warmup
Hello!
The warmup.c file is our main file.
Use "make" or "make all" to compile and the executable name will be run.
Intended input: ./run input.txt
Will output results in "output.txt" showing every combination of sum shared in the array.
**Extra Credit ^

My input1.txt provides a large output.txt, specifically because of the 0 case.

Time Complexity:
My algorithm is slow, and the core of it is a triple for loop.
Big Oh (Worst Case)
O(n^3)
